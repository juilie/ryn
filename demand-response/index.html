                    <p>As demand response has grown to become a significant capacity and energy resource it has also become the main focus of this consulting practice. Demand response offers many advantages, including the potential to help integrate intermittent renewable generation coming onto the electric grid and provide ancillary services and reserves. Demand response is increasingly being used in a very targeted way in collaboration with transmission planners to reduce loads on specific feeders and substations.</p>
